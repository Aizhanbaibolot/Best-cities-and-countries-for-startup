# **Statistical Analysis Startup Data**
### Project Overview <p>
The data is called The Best Cities and Countries for Startups. The dataset consists of 1000 records across 9 fields. I would like to answer two questions 
using the data. The first is to see if there is any correlation between quantity score and quality score of the countries. The second is to see if there
is a significant difference between total scores for cities with sign of change in position and without. I will use visualizations to show correlation,
and I will use t-test to test the significance of score differences for different cities with or without sign of change in position. Findings can be 
interesting for startupers as well as investors. The startupers will be interested in knowing which country or city to choose to realize their ideas. 
Also investors can use the findings to choose the correct location to invest their money and predict approximate scores.

### Hypothesis 1: <p>
* Ho: There is no statistically significant relationship between quantity score and quality score of the countries.
* Ha: There is a statistically significant relationship between quantity score and quality score of the countries.

* This visualization is made to see correlation between business, quality, and quantity scores at once, to save time and room. From here we can choose variables to work with in the Hypothesis part.

* This scatterplot shows correlation between quantity and quality scores of the cities. Colors indicates if there is a sign of change in position or not. As we can see the data is correlated and it is positive correlation.
  
* Strategy 2: Assume growth in revenue of cars, number of cars remains same
* Strategy 3: Assume decrease of car cost and insurance cost to maximize net revenue
Based on the achieved results I have developed strategies which that can optimize and forecaste revenue for 2019.
